## Flask Application Design

**Problem Analysis:**

- The problem statement is that there's a desire to create an online store using Python Flask where users can browse and buy products.

**Design:**

**HTML Files:**

1. **index.html:**
    - Website's homepage with a link to the products page.
    - Might include a header and footer for navigation and other essential elements.

2. **products.html:**
    - This page displays the list of all products in the store.
    - Users can view product details, add items to their shopping cart, and proceed to checkout.

3. **product_details.html:**
    - This page shows the details of a specific product.
    - It includes product images, description, price, and an option to add the product to the cart.

4. **cart.html:**
    - This page displays the items in the user's shopping cart.
    - Users can view the items, update quantities, and proceed to checkout.

5. **checkout.html:**
    - This page allows users to enter their personal and payment information to complete the purchase.

**Routes:**

1. **'/':**
    - This route handles the root URL and redirects to the homepage.

2. **'/products':**
    - This route serves the products page, showing all items available in the store.

3. **'/product/<product_id>':**
    - This route serves a specific product's details page, which includes product images, description, price, and an option to add it to the cart.

4. **'/cart':**
    - This route serves the shopping cart page, displaying the items in the user's cart and allowing them to update quantities and proceed to checkout.

5. **'/checkout':**
    - This route serves the checkout page, where users can enter personal and payment information to complete the purchase.

**Implementation Notes:**

- The actual implementation of the application involves connecting to a database, handling user authentication, managing product inventory, and storing orders securely. These are crucial aspects of a fully functional online store but fall outside the scope of our initial design.

- The specific HTML file designs and styles can be customized to align with the desired aesthetics of the online store, and the routes can be modified to accommodate additional functionality such as managing user accounts, processing orders, and tracking shipments.
